This project aims to parse, clean, model, and analyze MLB walkup songs from the official MLB website

 (no order):
 - split song column into artist and song columns
 - extrapolate logic to all teams - probably just call GET in loop or list of teams
 - add functional strucutre - get data function that will be called in main function
 - website includes spotify link to song, can use this rather than spotify API?
